# Anime_Recommendation

Project Description
This project implements an Anime Recommendation System using a combination of:
Content-Based Filtering - Recommends anime based on similar content (anime synopsis).
Collaborative Filtering - Recommends anime based on user rating patterns.
Hybrid Recommendation - Combines content-based and collaborative methods for more robust recommendations.


Files:
anime.csv: Contains basic information about anime (e.g., anime_id, Name, genre).
rating_complete.csv: Contains user ratings for anime (e.g., user_id, anime_id, rating).
anime_with_synopsis.csv: Contains extended anime information including their synopses.

Outputs:
Content-Based Recommendations:
   A list of anime with similar synopsis to the input anime.

Collaborative Recommendations:
   A list of anime recommended based on the user's rating history.

Hybrid Recommendations:
   A combined recommendation list with a balance between content-based and collaborative filtering.
